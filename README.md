# smart storage with web3py
Smart contract build with solidity and web3 python library. This project was made to help beginners in blockchain development to exercese their skills

## Technology & Tools
### [Solidity](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.17/)
Solidity is an object-oriented, high-level language for implementing smart contracts. Smart contracts are programs which govern the behaviour of accounts within the Ethereum state.
- [Python](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.17/)
Python is a high-level, general-purpose programming language. Its design philosophy emphasizes code readability with the use of significant indentation. Python is dynamically-typed and garbage-collected. It supports multiple programming paradigms, including structured (particularly procedural), object-oriented and functional programming. It is often described as a "batteries included" language due to its comprehensive standard library.[
- [web3](https://web3py.readthedocs.io/en/v5/)
Web3.py is a Python library for interacting with Ethereum.
-[Nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en/)
Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment with a focus on server-side and networking applications. Node.js allows developers to build fast, scalable network applications using easy-to-understand code. It runs on Windows OS, Mac OSX, Linux, Unix, and other operating systems.

- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
Visual Studio Code, also commonly referred to as VS Code, is a source-code editor made by Microsoft with the Electron Framework, for Windows, Linux and macOS. Features include support for debugging, syntax highlighting, intelligent code completion, snippets, code refactoring, and embedded Git. Users can change the theme, keyboard shortcuts, preferences, and install extensions that add additional functionality.
